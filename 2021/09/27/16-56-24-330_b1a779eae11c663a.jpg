He originally joined DCVC as an entrepreneur in residence, before becoming an operation partner and then a full-time partner earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>While he&#8217;s spent his entire career in the space industry, Boshuizen says that his ambitions to actually go to space started earlier still: He applied for pilot school in the Australian Defense Force Academy when he was just 17 but tested as partially color blind so he was disqualified from continuing.<\/p>\n<p>The current smallsat and CubeSat boom actually owes a lot to Boshuizen, too: When he was working at NASA, he helped invent the &#8220;Phonesat,&#8221; which was an orbital satellite effectively built from a modified smartphone. The primary reason micro satellite constellations exist today in such high numbers is that the miniaturization of high-tech components spurred by the rise of the smartphone made small, powerful satellites that are relatively affordable to build and launch possible.<\/p>\n<p>The flight is scheduled to take off on Tuesday, October 12, at 9:30 AM EST from Blue Origin&#8217;s sprawling Launch Site One just outside of Van Horn, Texas.

for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.<\/p>\n<p>Aria and Rebecca have a lot to share this week, so I&#8217;ll keep my intro short. I want to direct your attention to my latest <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autonocast.com\/blog\/2021\/9\/22\/236-ntsb-chair-jennifer-homendy\">podcast episode<\/a> over at The Autonocast. Myself, along with co-hosts Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, talk with recently-confirmed NTSB Chair <strong>Jennifer Homendy<\/strong> about automotive safety and what the wave of what she calls &#8220;partial automation&#8221; features in vehicles means for the industry and the consumer.<\/p>\n<p>The episode has garnered a lot of attention \u2014 some of it negative \u2014 because of our discussion about Tesla and the FSD software beta rolling out to owners. That&#8217;s an important issue considering that on Friday Tesla released a software update that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/09\/25\/tesla-drivers-can-request-fsd-beta-with-a-button-press-despite-safety-concerns.html\">allows owners to request access<\/a> to its Full Self-Driving Beta program. As I reported last week, drivers who get a high safety score from Tesla will get access. (This is happening as studies, like this newly released one conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/20\/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated\/\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <\/a>show drivers using Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system may become inattentive.)<\/p>\n<p>However, I hope listeners of the podcast episode will take away more from the conversation. For instance, I thought some of the more interesting comments were her thoughts on how Uber ATG reacted following the fatal crash involving its self-driving vehicle in Tempe several years ago.<\/p>\n<p>As always, you can email me at <a href=\"mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com\">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com<\/a> to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips.

Here were some of the highlights and major themes:<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h3>Product launches<\/h3>\n<p>Both <strong>Unagi Scooters<\/strong> and <strong>Cowboy<\/strong>\u00a0launched new products onstage at MMA. Unagi&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/unagis-2440-smart-scooter-includes-turn-by-turn-directions-and-gps-tracking\/\">high-end $2,440 smart scooter<\/a>, the Model Eleven, is very tech-advanced, with features like audible directions and GPS tracking powered by Google, remote kill in the case of theft and even an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) sensor. The bluetooth speakers allow riders to play their own music or podcasts as well as hear turn-by-turn directions. And since it&#8217;s an Unagi, it&#8217;s just as lightweight as you&#8217;d expect it to be, with a smooth ride on top of a dual suspension system.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in the ADAS system since I recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/10\/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility\/\">wrote about this trend<\/a>. The company says it&#8217;s the first two-wheeled device in the world with an integrated ADAS system that detects objects in the periphery and warns of impending collisions or dangers with audio and visual on the display. Users can disable it if they choose.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unagi chose to build these sensors into the scooter because improving safety is a big priority and crucial to the future of micromobility as a category that can replace cars in cities,&#8221; a spokesperson from Unagi told TechCrunch. &#8220;Unagi is aiming to leverage future technologies to eventually control motor and brake, but for now, the ADAS only warns of collisions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While the Model Eleven is pretty pricey for a scooter, a financing option will be available once it launches, and Unagi&#8217;s subscription model will become available down the line, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p>Cowboy&#8217;s launch of its slim-looking Cowboy 4 was also talk of the town at MMA. Customers have the option of choosing the aluminum frame to be step-through, which instantly makes it more accessible. An integrated &#8220;cockpit&#8221; is exclusively available on the C4, which is basically a built-in Quad Lock to securely mount a smartphone so the rider can access real-time information like GPS or fitness data through the Cowboy app. Once docked, phones can actually be charged using the bike&#8217;s internal battery.<\/p>\n<p>The C4 ebike can travel up to 20 miles per hour in the United States (they&#8217;re restricted to 15 mph in the UK and Europe) and ride for about 43 miles on a single charge. It&#8217;s not the fastest bike or best battery on the market, but she is a beauty. Along with this launch, Cowboy has also pointed to its large and ever expanding network of mobile ambassadors offering free repairs across seven countries, with nationwide coverage in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands.<\/p>\n<h3>Micromobility moves beyond scooters and bikes<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;We have a huge variety of products and form factors now,&#8221; Horace Dediu, an analyst, one of the hosts of MMA and the person who coined the term &#8216;micromobility,&#8217; told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have everything from monowheels like OneWheel, scooters with two wheels and three wheels. We have Arcimoto, we have bikes, we have motorcycles. We even have a very small automobile that&#8217;s basically a car.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s what micromobility is all about,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just one thing, one form factor. We need more kinds of form factors and there&#8217;s more coming. It feels like the eraly days of the personal computer or mobile phone era. Experiments are running and startups are trying things out, so it&#8217;s super exciting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Exhibit A: <strong>Andrew Yang<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MicromobilityCo\/status\/1441136695013871622\"> riding a OneWheel<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Coming out of the pandemic swinging<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;The pandemic actually really helped everybody to rethink their business model and make sure they focus on the efficiencies, so the mindset coming out of the pandemic is that it beat a lot of sense into people that you really have to run a sustainable business,&#8221; Tony Ho, VP of global business development at Segway-Ninebot, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Almost everybody here sees us coming out of the pandemic very strong, that&#8217;s the general feeling.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One way that feeling is manifesting for micromobility operators is in taking a look at cost of ownership and operational efficiencies, says Ho. Labor for charging vehicles and maintaining them is a huge part of getting the unit economics right, which is why we&#8217;re seeing a range of different tech working to address the problem and help operators run their fleets better, from scooters that you can summon to you or that can be teleoperated to move out of the way to scooters that have cameras built in to ensure safe rider behavior.<\/p>\n<h3>Reframing micromobility<\/h3>\n<p>When <strong>Ed Neidermeyer<\/strong>, director of communication of <strong>Partners for Automated Vehicle Educatio<\/strong>n and co-host with our own Kirsten Korosec on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autonocast.com\/\">Autonocast podcast<\/a>, first attended the MMA event two years ago, it was mostly a bubble of VCs, hardware startups and sharing companies. The public sector did not make much of an appearance, and it was probably still annoyed with companies for doing the VC thing and blitz-scaling to the point of annoyance and public hazard. Now, there&#8217;s been a systemic, cultural shift, which was reflected in the attendance at the event, says Neidermeyer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact that you had a presidential candidate (Andrew Yang) as a keynote speaker gives the event a cultural positioning and helps you frame it as, this is not just companies selling a device,&#8221; Neidermeyer told TechCrunch. &#8220;[Yang&#8217;s] presence effectively reflected this sort of broader reframing of micromobility as a system or as an alternate vision for mobility in cities.I think the space has matured a lot. There&#8217;s a lot less of that kind of VC bubble feel and much more like, how do we have a long term conversation about this.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Working together<\/h3>\n<p>Shared micromobility operators were onstage celebrating how much ridership has increased post-Covid due to the reduction of public transit use. Jesse Fittipaldi, chief strategy officer at compact electric utility vehicle company Arcimoto, said when micromobility first appeared on the scene, there were a lot of skeptics. Now that it&#8217;s become more mainstream, companies are seeing their numbers increase in ways they never thought would happen.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think hope is alive,&#8221; Fittipaldi told TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that the people need to be educated right now, and there are people here working to do that. The legislators, operators, venture capitalists and the banks, the software developers, all of the things that actually make these systems work &#8212; I see them here. I see them learning and transferring knowledge, and that&#8217;s key for where we are right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Others news from the week &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Bird integrates local operators into the app<\/h3>\n<p>Shared micromobility operator <strong>Bird<\/strong> announced the integration of local bikeshare providers into the Bird app so that multiple multimodal mobility options can all be seen in one place. The integration, which utilizes a General Bikeshare Feed Specification, an open source feed for public bikeshare companies, is now live in Oslo, Austin, Los Angeles, San Antonio and Milwaukee. Featured operators include <a href=\"https:\/\/oslobysykkel.no\/en\">Oslo City Bike<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/austin.bcycle.com\/\">Metrobike Austin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/bikeshare.metro.net\/\">Metro Bike<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sanantonio.bcycle.com\/\">SA Bikeshare<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bublrbikes.org\/\">Bublr Bikes Milwaukee<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The launch is part of Bird&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bird.co\/blog\/bird-unveils-new-smart-bikeshare-program-designed-multimodal-cities\/\"> Smart Bikeshare Program<\/a> first announced in June when the company also announced its new shared e-bikes. The integration allows more visibility for local operators and is completely cost free to them and to cities. Riders searching for vehicles in the Bird app will also be able to see nearby public bike stations with available bikes, and they can tap the icon to be taken to the local app to start the rental process.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210923005548\/en\/Helbiz-Partners-with-Drover-AI-to-Bring-Artificial-Intelligence-to-Scooter-Sharing<\/p>\n<h3>Fresh funds<\/h3>\n<p>New Zealand-based electric utility bike company <strong>Ubco<\/strong> announced an additional <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/electric-utility-bike-company-ubco-scores-10m-strategic-investment-with-tpk\/\">$10 million investment<\/a> from TPK Holdings, a previous investor who will now be leading the startup&#8217;s Series B. As part of the strategic investment, TPK, a Taiwanese electric components manufacturing company, will use its vast network to help Ubco secure parts and supplies for its flagship 2X2 bike more easily and cheaply. In the future, TPK will provide dedicated manufacturing support for Ubco&#8217;s new FRX1, a recreational off-road bike, and a four wheel utility vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Smart commercial scooter and bike parking and charging provider <strong>Bikeep<\/strong> closed a $3 million investment round which it will use to build up a partnership network with local companies to bring Bikeep stations to cities in the U.S., according to the company. British Columbia&#8217;s TransLink provides an example of what Bikeep looks like in the real world. It&#8217;s got smart locking systems as well as Bikeep&#8217;s IoT to create an on-demand bike locker program where cyclists can buy daily or monthly passes through the app.<\/p>\n<h3>Quadricycles, coming to a city near you<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Eli Electric Vehicles<\/strong>, a compact EV manufacturer, has announced the start of production of its flagship Eli Zero. It&#8217;s a tiny wee thing, made in the quadricycle fashion, complete with two seats and about 160 liters worth of storage in the trunk. The plan is to roll out small batches of the small electric vehicle across 10 European countries over the next few months. Starting price is about $11,999.<\/p>\n<h3>New two-wheel swag<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes<\/strong>, one of the most well-funded e-bike companies in North America, unveiled the RadCity 5 Plus, the next generation of its commuter ebike. The bike has a bit of an upgrade on its last model, with the ability to climb hills 40% faster and 11% more range. The more range is due to the new tires which include hydraulic disc brakes and longer-lasting ceramic pads for more stopping power and control. The bike also has a high-step and a step-thru frame and can accommodate riders from 4&#8217;8&#8243; to 6&#8217;5&#8243;. It&#8217;s available for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.radpowerbikes.com\/products\/radcity-plus-electric-commuter-bike\">pre-order online<\/a> now in the U.S. and Canada for $1,799 and will be coming to Europe in the winter.<\/p>\n<p>The founders of London-based e-bike company <strong>Analog Motion<\/strong> have launched a new brand of e-bikes called nothng (intentional lowercase and spelling error). The bike&#8217;s whole shtick is that less is more. The minimalist bike is an electric fixie that does come with head and tail lights, at least, but is generally going for fewer parts and less maintenance. It can reach a top speed of 20 miles per hour in the U.S., 16 miles per hour in Europe. The company is funding the bike with Indiegogo, and has already reached <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/nothng-an-electric-bike#\/\">559% of its funding goal<\/a>. Assuming the bike makes it to production, backers who have paid the \u00a3905 ($1,233) pre-order price should get their bikes by Spring 2022. By the way, that \u00a3905 is apparently 40% off the recommended retail price, which means when it comes to market this very simple bike will end up costing around \u00a31,500 ($2,050).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Harley Davidson&#8217;s<\/strong> bike arm, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.serial1.com\/\">Serial 1<\/a>, is selling a limited edition of its first e-bike, the MOSH\/TRIBUTE. It&#8217;s a vintage prototype that pays homage to HD&#8217;s Americana vibes, but it&#8217;s got all the tech you&#8217;d expect from a bike being released in 2021, including a powerful motor that reaches top speeds of 20 miles per hour and a removable, semi-integrated battery that can go up to 105 miles. Serial 1 is just releasing 650 units, half in the U.S. and half in Europe, with delivery expected for late Q4 this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Specialized<\/strong> has introduced its next-gen e-bikes, the Turbo Vado, Turbo Como and Turbo Tero. The bikes are meant to be smooth and comfortable, with the ability to improve functionality over time via over-the-air software updates and tech that addresses safety and theft specifically. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.specialized.com\/us\/en\/turbo-vado\">Vado 5.0<\/a> is ideal for city riders. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.specialized.com\/us\/en\/turbo-como\">Como 5.0<\/a> has a comfortable step-through design and an upright position for more comfort. It&#8217;s available for pre-order. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.specialized.com\/us\/en\/turbo-tero\">Tero 5.0<\/a> is built for all-terrain exploration and utility trips. All three bikes cost $5,000.<\/p>\n<p>Early stage NYC-based <strong>Pave Motors<\/strong> has announced its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pavemotors.com\/\">Pave Bike<\/a>, an e-moped that has the look and feel of an e-bike (kind of) with the small engine of motorcycle, is available for pre-order. The company recently successfully sold a limited supply of a first batch, and now is gearing up for more production. But this isn&#8217;t just any bike, folks. Apparently, Pave Bikes are connected to a private blockchain network that &#8220;enhances security by leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to unlock the Pave Bike, and enables secure sharing through smart rental contracts,&#8221; according to Pave.<\/p>\n<p>Each rider gets an NFT which they can access on the Pave+ app that gives them access to their bike without an internet connection. This also lets users share their bikes with friends or as a side hustle for payment. Neat, huh? The moped itself can hit a max speed of 30 miles per hour and offers 50 miles of range per charge. Pricing starts at $3,900 or $108 per month, and pre-orders can be submitted with a $100 deposit. The moped is expected to begin shipping at the start of next year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>\u2014 Rebecca Bellan<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Deal of the week<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png\" alt=\"money the station\" width=\"1600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not one giant deal that I want to flag this week; it&#8217;s a collection of them \u2014 all which are in the delivery and logistics sectors. The deal-making in these related industries has been fast and furious. Every week I think out loud: this surely is the end of this trend, right? Nope.<\/p>\n<p>Take this week as an example. <strong>DoorDash<\/strong> led a fundraising round in Berlin-based grocery delivery startup <strong>Flink SE<\/strong> with a pre-money valuation of $2.1 billion, according to sources <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-09-23\/doordash-said-to-lead-round-in-flink-at-2-1-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR\">cited by Bloomberg<\/a>.

That new financing will value Gorillas at about $3 billion after the deal is closed. DoorDash was reportedly negotiating an investment earlier this summer with Gorillas, however those talks eventually broke down.<\/p>\n<p>And then there is <strong>Best<\/strong>, the Chinese logistics company backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., that is considering a sale of its express delivery business. The company reportedly is seeking a valuation of as much as $1 billion for the business. Oh, and how can I forget, <strong>Project44<\/strong>, a real-time supply chain visibility company acquired last-mile tech platform <strong>Convey<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/project44-acquires-convey-for-225m-to-provide-end-to-end-supply-chain-visibility\/\">for $255 million<\/a>. Together, the two companies will combine forces to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility, from the raw materials to the front door.<\/p>\n<p>Sprinkled amongst these mega deals were smaller raises for same-day delivery and logistics companies, including a<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/last-mile-logistics-platform-cargamos-raises-11m-seed-round-to-expand-same-day-delivery\/\"> $7 million investment<\/a> into\u00a0Mexico City-based last-mile logistics platform <strong>Cargamos<\/strong> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery\/\">$28 million round<\/a> backing <strong>Jiffy<\/strong>, the London grocery delivery upstart that operates a network of dark stores to do fulfillment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Battery Resourcers<\/strong>, a startup that&#8217;s developing a closed-loop approach to lithium-ion battery materials, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/battery-resourcers-raises-70m-to-grow-closed-loop-battery-supply-chain\/\">raised $70 million<\/a> in mid-round funding that included participation from new investor Hitachi Ventures, as well as existing investors Orbia Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Doral Energy, At One Ventures, TDK Ventures and Trumpf Ventures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cars24,<\/strong> a site and app that sells users cars and used two-wheeled motorbikes, has raised<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/19\/indias-cars24-a-used-vehicle-marketplace-raises-450m-at-a-1-84b-valuation\/\"> $450 million<\/a> in a Series F round comprised of $340 million and $110 million in debt.

As TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao has noted in the past, &#8220;mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world.&#8221; But it appears that the startup is moving closer to commercialization as it aims to mass-produce cars equipped with its software by the end of this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Iron Ox<\/strong>, the San Francisco Bay Area-based autonomous farming startup, raised <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m\/\">$53 million<\/a> in a Series C led by <strong>Breakthrough Energy Ventures<\/strong>, brings the firm&#8217;s total funding up to $98 million.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Just Insure<\/strong>, a pay-per-mile insurance technology company, has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/just-insure-raises-8m\/\">raised $8 million in a funding round<\/a> co-led by CrossCut Ventures, ManchesterStory and Western Technology Investments.

Welcome back to Policy Corner. We&#8217;ve got a lot to get to today, so let&#8217;s get started.<\/p>\n<p>First, the chip shortage that&#8217;s held multiple industries by the throat for the past 18 months is continuing unabated. Consulting firm <strong>AlixPartners<\/strong> forecast this week that the shortage will cost the automotive industry $210 billion in this year alone &#8212; that&#8217;s up from the firm&#8217;s mid-year estimation of $110 billion.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing supply chain squeeze, the <strong>White House<\/strong> held its second summit with companies in the semiconductor market (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit\/\">TechCrunch covered the first meeting<\/a>), including <strong>Ford<\/strong>, <strong>Stellantis<\/strong>, <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company<\/strong>, <strong>General Motors<\/strong>, <strong>Intel<\/strong>, and <strong>Apple<\/strong>. While it&#8217;s unclear what exactly came out of the meeting, it was likely another information-sharing session, both between industry and government and also between industry players, especially the manufacturers of chips and their customers.<\/p>\n<p>Press Secretary <strong>Jen Psaki<\/strong> told reporters in advance of the meeting Thursday that Biden&#8217;s administration would continue to press for Congress to pass legislation to strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity for chips. There&#8217;s currently a bill in the House, the Chips for America Act, that would earmark $52 billion to shore up such capacity, but no action has yet been taken on it.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>In other news, let&#8217;s talk autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Spoiler alert: they&#8217;re not the same thing! Tech industry policy coalition <strong>Chamber of Progress<\/strong> recently questioned Senator Dianne Feinstein&#8217;s (D-CA) recent conflation of the two technologies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.feinstein.senate.gov\/public\/_cache\/files\/d\/6\/d6c67271-333b-42d4-b224-0f5e0e5ac520\/FE4F312C863205F66A7E6DD2A2E9F275.av-letter-to-nhtsa.pdf\">in a lette<\/a>r to the <strong>National Highway Transportation Safety Administration<\/strong> criticizing Tesla&#8217;s marketing of &#8220;Full Self Driving.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ariel Wolf<\/strong>, general counsel at the special interest group<strong> Self Driving Coalition<\/strong>, told Policy Corner in a recent interview that the group also continues to see ADAS and AVs being conflated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s damaging the public&#8217;s understanding of the two distinct technologies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question that that&#8217;s occurring, and it&#8217;s starting to bleed over and it&#8217;s creating this safety risk. In a very real sense it&#8217;s creating this safety risk because that conflation leads people to misuse the ADAS. But certainly it jeopardizes the future of AVs, because the public then looks at ADAS failures and targets AVs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Self Driving Coalition, along with over a dozen other groups including <strong>Alliance for Automotive Innovation<\/strong>, sent their own letter &#8212; to <strong>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg<\/strong>, urging the <strong>Department of Transportation<\/strong> to implement regulations and a framework for the safe deployment of AVs. Wolf said some of the biggest question marks include: creating a predictable timeline around caps on the number of AV models that can receive regulatory exemption from certain federal motor vehicle standards (these exemptions allow AV developers to test their vehicles in real-world environments); and how the Department plans to address novel vehicle designs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other pieces of news this week &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>California Governor <strong>Gavin Newsom<\/strong> signed into law a bill that will require all AVs to be electric by 2030. AV developers <strong>Cruise<\/strong>, <strong>Nuro<\/strong>, and <strong>Zoox<\/strong>, along with the <strong>Union of Concerned Scientists<\/strong>, each came out in favor of the bill.

This case is notable for two reasons: one, it&#8217;s an example of private citizens bringing a climate change lawsuit against a company; and two, it will require the two automakers to show that they are doing everything they can to meet Germany&#8217;s statutory climate targets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>\u2014 Aria Alamalhodaei<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Notable news and other tidbits<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Autonomous vehicles<\/h3>\n<p><strong>FedEx<\/strong> has started to use <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/fedex-to-test-auroras-self-driving-trucks-on-dallas-to-houston-route\/\">self-driving trucks<\/a> to haul goods between Dallas and Houston as part of a pilot program with autonomous vehicle startup <strong>Aurora<\/strong> and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer <strong>Paccar<\/strong>.

The federal tax credit will provide another $7,500 off of the sticker price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rivian<\/strong> plans to open a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/rivian-will-open-a-4-6m-service-support-center-as-it-prepares-for-first-vehicle-sales\/\">service support operations facility<\/a> for vehicle owners in Plymouth, Michigan ahead of deliveries of the launch edition of the R1T pickup. The facility will create 100 new jobs and come at an investment of $4.6 million, $750,000 of which comes from a business development grant from the state.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workhorse Group<\/strong> recalled 41 of its C-1000 cargo delivery vehicles and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/workhorse-group-suspends-deliveries-recalls-c-1000-electric-delivery-van\/\">suspended the remainder<\/a> of its deliveries for this model, telling regulators that &#8220;additional testing&#8221; is needed to certify the vehicles under Federal safety standards.

OnStar already expanded OnStar Guardian earlier this year with the introduction of the Guardian app, which lets customers access the service via their mobile device.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/china-roundup\/\">TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup<\/a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">On Friday, Huawei&#8217;s chief financial executive Meng Wanzhou was released from house arrest in Vancouver after reaching a breakthrough deal with the U.S. Justice Department. Chinese startups that announced major funding rounds this week include Momenta, a Daimler-backed autonomous driving startup, Nreal, an augmented reality company, and Hai Robotics, a warehouse robotics maker.<\/p>\n<h2>Landmark deal<\/h2>\n<p>Meng, the daughter of Huawei&#8217;s founder Ren Zhengfei, entered an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution\">agreement<\/a> with the U.S. Justice Department in which she admitted to some wrongdoing while prosecutors deferred wire and bank fraud charges against her and could dismiss the indictment in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, Meng was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/05\/huawei-cfo-arrested-in-canada-awaits-us-extradition\/?utm_source=tctwreshare&amp;sr_share=twitter\">arrested<\/a> in Vancouver, Canada on suspicion she violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iran. Over the years, her case has become an irritant in straining U.S.-China relations. Around the time Meng took off for Shenzhen, home to Huawei&#8217;s headquarters, on Friday, China released two Canadians who have been detained on spying charges. Beijing has repeatedly denied connections between the detention of the two Canadians and Meng&#8217;s arrest.<\/p>\n<p>Through a remote court appearance via video on Friday, Meng pleaded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2021\/09\/24\/huawei-meng-wanzhou-new-york-court-hearing-514134\">not guilty<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution\">charges<\/a> of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bank fraud and wire fraud. However, she admitted to the basic facts underpinning the DOJ&#8217;s charges, which include &#8220;multiple material misrepresentations to a senior executive of a financial institution regarding Huawei\u2019s business operations in Iran in an effort to preserve Huawei\u2019s banking relationship with the financial institution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei Technologies, admitted today that she failed to tell the truth about Huawei\u2019s operations in Iran, and as a result, the financial institution continued to do business with Huawei in violation of U.S. law. Our prosecution team continues to prepare for trial against Huawei, and we look forward to proving our case against the company in court,&#8221; said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the DOJ&#8217;s Criminal Division in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-admits-misleading-global-financial-institution\">release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>China&#8217;s news outlets have largely left out Meng&#8217;s confirmation of wrongdoings and internet users rushed to triumph the Huawei executive&#8217;s release after three years. Within hours, posts hashtagged #MengWanzhouReturningToMotherland have garnered <a href=\"https:\/\/s.weibo.com\/weibo?q=%23%E5%AD%9F%E6%99%9A%E8%88%9F%E5%8D%B3%E5%B0%86%E5%9B%9E%E5%88%B0%E7%A5%96%E5%9B%BD%23\">over 1 billion views<\/a> on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to seeing Meng Wanzhou returning home safely to be reunited with her family. Huawei will continue to defend itself against the allegations in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York,&#8221; the company said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Huawei\/status\/1441674650606473222\">statement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meng <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/video\/china\/3150085\/meng-wanzhou-returns-china-and-canadians-freed-after-us-court-reaches-deal\">said<\/a> upon her release the past three years have been &#8220;a disruptive time&#8221; for her as &#8220;a mother, a wife and a company executive.&#8221; In a <a href=\"https:\/\/news.cgtn.com\/news\/2021-09-25\/Huawei-s-Meng-Wanzhou-releases-statement-detailing-her-feelings-13QoRMK0kiQ\/index.html\">statement<\/a>, she said support from China, both at the governmental and civil level, gave her faith and kept her going during the &#8220;dark moments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meng&#8217;s return might boost employee morale at Huawei but the telecom equipment and smartphone giant continues to suffer from the aftershocks caused by U.S. sanctions. Huawei will see revenue from its smartphone business drop by at least $30-40 billion in 2021, its chairman Eric Xu <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/huawei-2021-smartphone-revenue-drop-by-least-30-40-bln-rotating-chairman-2021-09-24\/\">said Friday<\/a>. Once a global handset leader, Huawei has fallen out of the top ranks and been unseated by its Chinese rivals, with Xiaomi overtaking Apple as the second best-selling brand worldwide <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/15\/xiaomi-global-shipments-push-past-apple-for-no-2-spot\/\">in Q2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Huawei lost access to critical chip components and software after the Trump Administration<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/19\/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list\/\"> put it on an export blacklist<\/a>.

Industrial robots are in demand in China as the government calls for greater efficiency to deal with labor shortage in its manufacturing sector. As Huang He, an investor focused on industrial autoamtion, previously told me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Youngsters these days would rather become food delivery riders than work in a factory. The work that robots replace is the low-skilled type, and those that still can\u2019t be taken up by robots pay well and come with great benefits.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, he warned that the market might be overheated:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u00a0There\u2019s this bizarre phenomenon in China, where the most funded and valuable industrial robotic firms are generating less than 30 million yuan in annual revenue and not really heard of by real users in the industry.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In August, another warehouse robotics startup, Syrius, which is also based in the hardware haven of Shenzhen, announced it had raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.therobotreport.com\/syrius-robotics-completes-series-b-funding-round\/\">over $20 million<\/a> led by ByteDance.<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello and welcome back to\u00a0TechCrunch\u2019s China roundup, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.

However, YouTube is saying that it will only renew &#8220;if NBCU offers us equitable terms&#8221; and said it would drop monthly prices by $10 from $64.99 to $54.99 while the channels are off the platform. It even encouraged users to sign up for NBC&#8217;s Peacock streaming service for $4.99 per month in order to retain NBCU content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:<\/strong> <em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/youtube-tv-may-drop-nbc-channels-because-of-a-contract-dispute-080653391.html\">Engadget<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NBC Universal has warned YouTube TV subscribers that 14 of its channels may be removed, and YouTube says it will drop its monthly price by $10 if the situation isn&#8217;t resolved and channels go away.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5302483,"featured_media":2208608,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"09ff4356-7fdb-3ce0-9fab-afd66bc1294b"},"categories":[25515,17396],"tags":[269423,576900111,6567,449560265],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Apple-iPhone-Event-2021-2021-09-27-at-12.30.32-PM.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3m3PU19","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2167187],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/youtube-tv-may-drop-nbc-channels-because-of-a-contract-dispute-080653391.html","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2208606"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2208606"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2208606\/revisions"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/steve-dent"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2208606&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/5302483"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2208608"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2208606"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2208606"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2208606"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2208606"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2208606"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2208606"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2208606"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2167187,"name":"Steve Dent","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/steve-dent\/","description":"Steve Dent is an associate editor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\">Engadget<\/a>.","slug":"steve-dent","links":{"twitter":""},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Steve Dent is an associate editor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\">Engadget<\/a>.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":""}],"author":[{"id":5302483,"name":"Darrell Etherington","url":"","description":"Writer covering space, science and health tech.

Plus, this July, TikTok became the first non-Facebook app to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/sensortower.com\/blog\/tiktok-downloads-3-billion\">3 billion global downloads<\/a>, per app analytics firm SensorTower.<\/p>\n<p>The competition that TikTok poses to Western tech giants is palpable &#8212; Instagram, owned by Facebook, has radically shifted its focus, declaring that it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/instagram-now-supports-60-second-videos-on-reels-its-tiktok-clone\/\">no longer a photo-sharing app<\/a>. Instagram is heavily promoting Reels, its TikTok clone, and even discussion forums like Reddit are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/13\/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios\/\">enticed by the promise<\/a> of short-form video feeds. Instagram even advised creators that if they recycle watermarked TikToks as posts on Reels, the content will be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CLFMSunBRX1\/\">less discoverable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/tiktok-hits-1-billion-monthly-active-users-globally-company-2021-09-27\/\">\u00a0said<\/a> that its biggest markets are in the United States, Europe, Brazil, and Southeast Asia, even though its parent company ByteDance is headquartered in China. Of course, TikTok has faced severe regulatory threats in recent years &#8212; former President Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report\/\">attempted to block<\/a> U.S. business transactions with TikTok, and in India, home to 1.36 billion people, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps\/\">TikTok has been banned<\/a> since last year.<\/p>\n<p>Despite it all, TikTok continues to exhibit impressive growth. As recently as last month, TikTok parent ByteDance bought the VR hardware company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/30\/tiktok-owner-bytedance-buys-a-top-virtual-reality-hardware-company\/\">Pico<\/a>, indicating a potential future expansion into VR.

Warby Parker is also set to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/eyewear-maker-warby-parker-to-go-public-via-direct-listing-on-nyse-2021-08-24-0\">direct list later<\/a> this week &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public\/\">more on its numbers here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Expect a raft of coverage from TechCrunch on both debuts.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you are tired of IPOs, these two warrant your attention. The Amplitude debut is notable for its status as a direct listing that follows a large private-market fundraising. The company is pursuing a liquidity model that both leverages ample private fundraising and dodges pricing issues present in traditional IPOs that have irked many in the Silicon Valley chattering classes.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on Extra Crunch<\/a> or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>And the Warby offering will help set &#8212; or correct &#8212; market sentiment regarding D2C companies; the unicorn isn&#8217;t even a technology company in the eyes of many.

It&#8217;s either pesky bankers extracting unearned value from hardworking Silicon Valley types at graduation day, or it&#8217;s private-market investors irked that anyone else accretes upside from startups.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about how we&#8217;ll sort the matter.<\/p>\n<h2>Raise, then direct list<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen a number of direct listings in recent years. Spotify is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/03\/spotify-opens-at-165-90-valuing-company-at-30-billion\/\">perhaps the best remembered<\/a>. But Asana <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/asanas-strong-direct-listing-lights-alternative-path-to-public-market-for-saas-startups\/\">also went out via a direct listing<\/a>. As <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/23\/wise-formerly-transferwise-confirms-direct-listing-on-the-lse-in-early-july-reportedly-at-a-6b-7b-valuation\/\">did Wise<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap\/\">Squarespace<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/15\/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups\/\">Coinbase<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/08\/the-roblox-gambit\/\">Roblox<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Amplitude will also float without raising primary capital in its public debut. It raised a huge stack of funds earlier this year &#8212; $150 million at a valuation of just under $4.2 billion, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/funding_round\/amplitude-series-f--92399aff\">per Crunchbase data<\/a>. This method of raising private capital and then direct listing decouples the traditional IPO, which combines a primary raise and a public flotation.<\/p>\n<p>Another variation on the method is to direct list, later raising primary funds through a follow-on offering once the market has set what is perhaps a fairer price for the equity of the company in question. There is also work afoot to allow companies to direct list <em>and<\/em> raise primary capital, shifting pricing power from banks to public investors more directly. That final option is still more theory than applicable exercise.<\/p>\n<p>So, unicorns that don&#8217;t want to pursue a traditional IPO can raise private funds before or after a direct listing in an attempt to get around the exorbitant first-day pops that some firms have recorded in recent quarters.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Roblox is an example of the raise-then-direct list method. It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/19\/roblox-files-to-go-public\/\">filed to go public <\/a>but shelved its IPO after seeing a few other companies storm out of the gate. The gaming company went on to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing\/\">raise private funds in early 2021<\/a>, and then direct list. Squarespace was similar: It <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation\/\">raised $300 million at a flat $10.0 billion valuation<\/a> (post-money) this March before direct listing in May.<\/p>\n<p>This is the model that Amplitude and Warby Parker will test this week.

workforce, expand R&amp;D and build a 20,000-square-foot pilot manufacturing facility in Alameda. The investment follows $7 million of seed rounds previously raised from a group of backers including RXBAR founder Peter Rahal.<\/p>\n<p>New Age Meats is starting with sausage because it is one of the foods that had the fastest way to market, but the company will eventually move into other meat categories like beef and chicken, Spears said.<\/p>\n<p>He expects to be able to go to market in 2022, pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He also sees demand for products coming from markets that eat a lot of pork, like Asia.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The cultured meat landscape is gaining new entrants as the technology has evolved. Spears said New Age is differentiating itself by concentrating on delivering on the experience for customers that like eating meat and doing it in a way that is scalable and affordable.<\/p>\n<p>While Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat were some of the first in the meat alternative space, other companies have come into it with a focus on cultured meat and are also attracting venture capital; for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/animal-alternative-makes-a-platform-play-in-the-growing-market-of-cultured-meat\/\">Animal Alternative<\/a> and Eat Just\u2019s Good Meat,

announced another $97 million<\/a> in funding.<\/p>\n<p>Hanwha Solutions, which corresponded via email, said that its business mission aligned with New Age Meats and sees potential for growth in the cell-based pork market.<\/p>\n<p>And, given worldwide efforts to address climate change, Hanwha \u201cexpected rapid market growth\u201d in the food tech industry, particularly around cultured meat.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing awareness for healthy food and animal rights will also fuel the demand,\u201d the company said. \u201cWith its expertise in using cell technology to produce cultured meats, New Age Meats will help us expand our business horizon.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Okyhl4owQM\"><p><a

to cloud-based architectures, they are also taking on more applications (because they can) and, as a result of that, more complex workloads and storage needs. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence applications add even more complexity. Now a startup that has built technology to make that process move faster and more efficiently is announcing a round of funding to address those enterprises&#8217; evolving needs. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asteralabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Astera Labs<\/a>, a fabless semiconductor company that builds connectivity solutions that help remove bottlenecks around high-bandwidth applications and help better allocate resources around enterprise data, has raised $50 million.<\/p>\n<p>The Series C values the company at $950 million post-money, the company confirmed.<\/p>\n<p>Fidelity Management and Research is leading the round with Atreides Management and Valor Equity Partners &#8212; two other new backers &#8212; also participating, and previous investors Avigdor Willenz Group, GlobalLink1 Capital, Intel Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and VentureTech Alliance also participating.<\/p>\n<p>Intel (which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/12\/intel-has-invested-132m-in-11-startups-this-year-on-track-for-300m-500m-in-total\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first invested in 2020<\/a>) is a strategic backer in this case, meaning a financial investor and significant customer. Sanjay Gajendra, Astera&#8217;s chief business officer, notes that the chip giant is collaborating with the startup to develop PCI Express and CXL (Compute Express Link) technology and products to &#8220;increase bandwidth, performance, and resource availability in next generation server and storage infrastructure.&#8221; With AI use cases being a central part of Intel&#8217;s next-generation growth strategy, these will be essential for building AI-based systems based on Intel&#8217;s processors, he said, adding that Aries Smart Retimers for PCIe are also featured in multiple reference designs and commercial platforms from Intel.<\/p>\n<p>Other partners and customers include TSMC, Wistron, Samsung Electronics and Western Digital.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this, Santa Clara-based Astera had previously only raised $35 million in three years, which speaks to its own efficiency as a business, and the fact that it&#8217;s been generating healthy revenues already.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to join forces with Fidelity, Atreides, and Valor to cement our leadership position in intelligent cloud connectivity solutions and usher Astera Labs into the next growth phase of our company,\u201d said Jitendra Mohan, CEO, Astera Labs, in a statement. \u201cWith this investment and increased collaboration with our manufacturing partners, we will rapidly scale our worldwide operations to satisfy incredible customer demand and launch multiple new product lines to solve the industry\u2019s most pressing connectivity challenges.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This latest funding round, more specifically, is also coming on the back of what has been a relatively strong period for the company in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the shift it precipitated in migrations to the cloud among organizations.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;With a step-function increase in folks working\/studying from home and relying on cloud-based SaaS\/PaaS applications, the deployment of scalable hardware infrastructure has accelerated,&#8221; Gajendra said in an email to TechCrunch. He claims that solutions could provide up to double the bandwidth on the same infrastructure. &#8220;This has driven our sales demand from the world\u2019s largest cloud operators by an estimated 25% to 30%.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Astera&#8217;s fabless approach is giving the company a faster route to scaling its technology and selling it on to more providers at a time when we are very much caught in a race for more bandwidth but also a finite amount of cost and resource for simply adding more capacity: this means that companies that are building solutions to improve the efficiency of systems that are already in place will continue to get a lot of attention from the market, and investors. This is an issue that extends to different aspects of enterprise IT: for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Firebolt<\/a> is building architecture and algorithms to reduce the bandwidth needed specifically for handling big data analytics.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vne2VkPWXv\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics\/\">Firebolt raises $127M more for its new approach to cheaper and more efficient Big Data analytics<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Firebolt raises $127M more for its new approach to cheaper and more efficient Big Data analytics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics\/embed\/#?secret=vne2VkPWXv\" data-secret=\"vne2VkPWXv\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Avigdor Willenz is not only a founding investor in Astera Labs, but he was also one of the first to back other major processing startups, including Annapurna Labs (now owned by Amazon), Habana Labs (now owned by Intel) and many others. \u201cAstera Labs has done a tremendous job in developing a portfolio of multiple innovative products that address critical needs of heterogeneous computing and composable disaggregation infrastructure,\u201d said Willenz in a statement.

Space Force awards $87.5M to Rocket Lab, SpaceX, Blue Origin, ULA for next-gen rocket testing"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The U.S. Space Force, the military branch spun out of the Air Force in December 2019, has announced its next batch of awards for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements.<\/p>\n<p>The awards were granted by the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC), a program managed by the Space Force\u2019s Space Systems Command. SpEC facilitates engagement between the U.S. Department and Defense and the space industry, by allowing its nearly 600 members to compete for contracts. The awards, which total $87.5 million, were granted to four launch companies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blue Origin, which will receive $24.3 million to develop cryogenic fluid management for the upper stage of the New Glenn rocket.<\/li>\n<li>United Launch Alliance, which will get $24.3 million for uplink command and control for its new Vulcan Centaur two-stage heavy-lift rocket.<\/li>\n<li>Rocket Lab, whose contract award is also $24.3 million, one of the highest in the company\u2019s history. Those funds will go toward upper-stage development of the company\u2019s forthcoming Neutron medium-lift rocket.<\/li>\n<li>SpaceX, which will get $14.4 million for combustion stability analysis and testing of its Raptor rocket engine.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>SpaceX and ULA are already established launch providers for the U.S. government under the Space Force\u2019s National Security Space Launch program. Both Rocket Lab and Blue Origin will be able to compete for the next series of launch procurement contracts in 2024. These latest contracts are a sign that the two companies are gearing up to submit their bids. (Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman lost to SpaceX and ULA in 2020.)<\/p>\n<p>Regarding the new award, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a statement that it is a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in the Neutron rocket. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a trusted launch system with Electron, and we\u2019ll do it again with Neutron to continue providing unfettered access to space with our new heavier-lift vehicle.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The U.S. Space Force, the military branch spun out of the Air Force in December 2019, has announced its next batch of awards for projects related to next-gen rocket engine testing and upper-stage improvements.

The transaction will increase competition and bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in the dynamic and competitive CRM and business messaging spaces. More people will benefit from customer service that is faster, richer and available whenever and however they need it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the CMA has decided there&#8217;s nothing to see here, the EU is still considering whether to clear Facebook-Kustomer.

but confirmed its own &#8220;in-depth investigation&#8221; is ongoing, adding that there&#8217;s a provisional deadline of January 7, 2022, for EU regulators to take their own decision.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the CMA&#8217;s relatively quick clearance of this particular Facebook purchase, the U.K. regulator does <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/01\/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy\/\">continue to dig into competition concerns<\/a> attached to Facebook&#8217;s earlier acquisition of animated gif platform, Giphy.<\/p>\n<p>After a finding of provisional concerns on Facebook-Giphy earlier this summer, it proposed remedies that could include ordering Facebook to unwind the acquisition &#8212; leading the tech giant to respond with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08\/\">a stinging rebuttal of any harms<\/a>, earlier this month, accusing the regulator of making &#8220;fundamental errors&#8221; in its assessment of the competitive implications of that deal.<\/p>\n<p>Regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech&#8217;s acquisitions in the region tends to focus on a fairly narrow consideration of competitive harms &#8212; such as how the CMA has looked at the Kustomer buy through the lens of the overall competitiveness of the CRM market.<\/p>\n<p>However, in the Kustomer case, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iccl.ie\/digital-data\/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer\/\">concerns<\/a> have also been raised about the privacy implications of letting adtech giant Facebook get its hands on the support service&#8217;s customer data given that the smaller company operates in sectors including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kustomer.com\/industry\/healthcare\/\">the health sector<\/a> where it is likely to be processing sensitive information on behalf of its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Back in February, for instance, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) raised a series of privacy concerns in a letter to Facebook &#8212; which it also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iccl.ie\/digital-data\/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer\/\">published online<\/a>, querying what uses the tech giant would be making for customer data held by Kustomer and asking whether such data would be combined with any other data held by Facebook and Facebook-owned companies.<\/p>\n<p>Months later the ICCL <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/06\/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral\/\">said<\/a> it had not had any response from Facebook to the letter raising privacy concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Despite Europe&#8217;s comprehensive data protection framework &#8212; which is supposed to help safeguard people&#8217;s digital information &#8212; competition watchdogs in the region rarely consider privacy implications as part of their assessments of digital markets.<\/p>\n<p>And there have been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/18\/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power\/\">calls for more joined up working<\/a> between competition and privacy regulators in order to properly tackle the market effects and consumer harms that can flow from digital giants&#8217; command of other people&#8217;s information.<\/p>\n<p>One outlier on this front is German&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO), which has been doing just that &#8212; in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/23\/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling\/\">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling<\/a> (which is ongoing).<\/p>\n<p>The FCO is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bundeskartellamt.de\/SharedDocs\/Meldung\/EN\/Pressemitteilungen\/2021\/23_07_2021_Facebook_Kustomer.html;jsessionid=56124766822035B0C7DD34AEA6AF42A1.2_cid362?nn=3591568\">also looking at<\/a> whether Facebook&#8217;s plans to acquire Kustomer fall under the scope of German merger control rules.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ocSGUcfwmV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/18\/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power\/\">Perspectives on tackling Big Tech&#8217;s market power<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy them at home when Beyond starts selling them through retailers. You&#8217;ll find the $5 tenders at Walmart and other major grocery chains starting in October, though only in select markets. Beyond expects to expand availability later this year.<\/p>\n<p>The company says its tenders have 50 percent less saturated fat than ones made with actual chicken, and have no GMOs, antibiotics, hormones or cholesterol. Beyond uses faba beans rather than a soy-based recipe in its attempt to replicate the taste and texture of a chicken tender. It says you&#8217;ll be able to heat up the pre-cooked tenders in under 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Along with Walmart, Beyond&#8217;s tenders will be available at some Jewel-Osco, Safeway NorCal, Harris Teeter, Giant Foods and ShopRite stores at the outset. Meanwhile, Beyond says it&#8217;s increasing availability of its products at Walmart.

Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.<\/p>\n<p>So, let me try that again.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Nicole Quinn (Lightspeed Venture Partners) + Vlad Novakovski (Lunchclub)<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>October 6 &#8211; 3pm ET\/12pm PT<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Nicole Quinn, partner at Lightspeed, has spent her career helping startups reach their target audiences on digital platforms.

Refresh cycles being what they are for consoles, hardware makers love to juice sales in their middle-age with some compelling new model.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This serves the dual-purpose of (hopefully) bringing long-time holdouts on board and convincing the devoted it\u2019s time to upgrade to something shiny and new. It\u2019s worth noting that, in mid-2019, Nintendo did introduce two models. There was a refresh of the standard Switch that addressed far and away the system\u2019s biggest downside: battery. The company also added the $200 Switch Lite &#8212; a more affordable and portable version of the console that helped get me through the first year of this pandemic in one piece.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208238\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208238\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2208238\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208238\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Nintendo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Rumors of a Switch Pro were at full-force ahead of E3. What arrived was, for many, underwhelming, featuring the same RAM and processor (Nvidia Tegra X1) as its predecessor and a slightly larger display (0.8 inches) than its predecessor. The seven-inch OLED is still 720p (1080p when docked), and not the the 4K some were expecting. It does add some other features, like a wired LAN connection and double the storage to 64GB, without ditching the microSD slot.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208244\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208244\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2208244\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208244\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Waiting to play, I snapped a few quick shots of some OLED models on display, showcasing demos of Mario Kart. The system is striking in its black and white stormtrooper colors. When I finally got my hands on the system, the first thing that struck me was the weight. Granted, playing the Switch Lite for the past year has messed with my perspective on the matter, but the Switch OLED is also heavier than its predecessor, up to 0.93 pounds from 0.88.<\/p>\n<p>While not improving the resolution, the new OLED technology does bring some upgrades &#8212; namely deeper blacks and higher contrast than the original. It\u2019s fitting then &#8212; and likely not entirely coincidental &#8212; that the system launches with a dark, subterranean title like Metroid Dread. It\u2019s a nice combo, and the improved sound offers a tactile feedback for loud sounds &#8212; something you get a lot of when firing rockets from your arm cannon.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208236\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208236\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2208236\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208236\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Nintendo<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Still, the Switch OLED may be a hard sell for those who have the original. Metroid Dread, on the other, is a bit more of a no-brainer. I was only afforded the time to play the early stages, but the game triggered the same sensory receptors that made the original (and subsequent side-scrollers).

He originally joined DCVC as an entrepreneur in residence, before becoming an operation partner and then a full-time partner earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>While he&#8217;s spent his entire career in the space industry, Boshuizen says that his ambitions to actually go to space started earlier still: He applied for pilot school in the Australian Defense Force Academy when he was just 17 but tested as partially color blind so he was disqualified from continuing.<\/p>\n<p>The current smallsat and CubeSat boom actually owes a lot to Boshuizen, too: When he was working at NASA, he helped invent the &#8220;Phonesat,&#8221; which was an orbital satellite effectively built from a modified smartphone. The primary reason micro satellite constellations exist today in such high numbers is that the miniaturization of high-tech components spurred by the rise of the smartphone made small, powerful satellites that are relatively affordable to build and launch possible.<\/p>\n<p>The flight is scheduled to take off on Tuesday, October 12, at 9:30 AM EST from Blue Origin&#8217;s sprawling Launch Site One just outside of Van Horn, Texas.

We were designing an experience for tweens (10-12yo), and it was never going to be the same as Instagram today. Parents approve tween accounts and have oversight over who they follow, who follows them, who messages them, time spent etc.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But the project leaked way before we knew what it would be. People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. Recent WSJ reporting caused even greater concern.

Now you can define the message and the marketer will have all of the data and be able to get feedback and analysis of what the customer segment looks like.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketresearchfuture.com\/reports\/multichannel-marketing-market-3949\">global multichannel marketing market<\/a> is expected to reach $28 billion by 2027, Yakuel said it will be an advantage to know who a brand\u2019s customers are and how to target them. Optimove\u2019s analysis of the data provides insights on how to achieve and attribute measurable improvement in such areas as churn, conversion, reactivation and lifetime value for each customer and campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to this investment, Optimove was bootstrapped for the first four years until raising $20 million. Yakuel said the company hasn\u2019t used the money yet \u2014 it has been profitable so far. He considers the round to be Summit Partners, which is buying out the company\u2019s earlier investors, as making a bigger commitment to the company.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIt is a transition and phase into a new era,\u201d he added. \u201cIt felt like the right time for us given the specific climate of fundraising. We also want to do some M&amp;A and build out our platform, but that all has to be done seamlessly. To use us today, a business may also have to use three or four other solutions and stitch them together. If we can own some of those capabilities, we can be better partners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition to M&amp;A, the company plans to double its staff of 300 over the next two years and invest in technology, R&amp;D and engineering to serve its 500 brand customers, including BetMGM, Papa John\u2019s and Staples.<\/p>\n<p>In the past year, the company saw an increase of 40% annual recurring revenue, and it sends more than 23 billion optimized messages via email, mobile, ad platforms and other channels, to over 3 billion customers annually. Next up for the company, Yakuel expects the next milestone to be an initial public offering in three years.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the funding, the company said Summit Partners\u2019 head of Europe, Han Sikkens, and managing director, Steffan Peyer, are joining its board of directors.<\/p>\n<p>Peyer said Summit invests in companies that are focused on marketing technology and are out to understand the customer journey, especially as that has become more important during the global pandemic. During this time, the cost of acquiring new customers has risen and this is where Optimove is most beneficial \u2014 enabling engagement with existing user bases, he added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat they have done is build a sophisticated customer data platform, with a sophisticated analytics orchestration engine, predicated on understanding and review the behavior of the customer and targeting micro segment campaigns to ensure the engagement level is good, and if there are other products that could be sold to a particular customer,\u201d Peyer said. \u201cTheir modeling has a strong backend infrastructure to process data at scale and leverage that information in real time.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"

so-called &#8220;triangulation&#8221; approach to the challenge of cybersecurity covering endpoints, networks and microservices, has picked up $20 million. The Series A is led by Eight Road Venutres, with <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MMC Ventures, Crane Venture Partners and Winton Ventures Limited &#8212; all existing backers &#8212; also participating. SenseOn &#8212; not to be confused with cabinet security business <a href=\"http:\/\/senseon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senseon<\/a> &#8212; previously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/19\/senseon-raises-6-4m-to-tackle-cybersecurity-threats-with-an-ai-triangulation-approach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">raised $6.4 in a seed round of funding<\/a> in 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The funding is coming the back of very strong growth, both the bad and good kind.<\/p>\n<p>The bad growth is the sort that we unfortunately hear about every day, in the form of cybersecurity breaches: SenseOn estimates that compromised records passed the 37 billion mark in 2020 &#8212; up 141% over 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The good growth is that SenseOn itself has been rising to the challenge for its customers, and as a result its own business has grown (in revenues and engagements) by over 350%. The London-based startup, founded and led by David Atkinson \u2014 who had previously been the commercial director for Darktrace and before that spent years pioneering new cybersecurity techniques at the U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defense as well as other military and government roles &#8212; counts a number of financial services firms, consumer businesses and government organizations among its customers.<\/p>\n<p>The problem that SenseOn has identified is that the world of security today has evolved to contain a plethora of point solutions, as well as differing approaches within those point solutions, to address different aspects of the cybersecurity challenge. While some of these are very effective, they are only taking on some of the battle, and if an organization wants to adopt the most secure policy, it might use a number of these in tandem, which in turn can slow down systems and response, or create other issues within them.<\/p>\n<p>SenseOn&#8217;s solution has been to build a system that essentially aims to do everything together, with some parts of the solution built by itself, and some parts integrating with other products.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Atkinson describes the approach not unlike &#8220;how a human analyst thinks&#8221; (which is why the AI aspect of the service, balancing different streams of information, is central to the approach). He also says it is similar to how a global positioning system works: &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the more satellites [a GPS] triangulates off, the more accurate it is.&#8221;<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2208434\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?w=298\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg 960w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=298,300 298w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=768,773 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=676,680 676w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px\" \/> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And t<\/span>o borrow a little from Atkinson&#8217;s previous role in the military (he&#8217;s pictured here, on the right, in a helicopter in Afghanistan years ago), SenseOn is building not just weapons that security specialists can use to do their jobs better &#8212; the platform and the apps &#8212; but also ammunition &#8212; in the form of data that SenseOn picks up and organizes &#8212; to use with those weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Acknowledging the fragmentation inherent in a lot of the most intelligent security technology point solutions, and tackling that by integrating different silos of information to create more complete pictures, is something that seems to be catching on. I&#8217;d also argue that it is a sign of the industry maturing, with possibly some distinct platforms emerging as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Cybellum, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/lg-is-acquiring-automotive-cybersecurity-startup-cybellum-in-a-240m-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LG acquired last week<\/a>, is taking the same approach but focusing specifically on automotive security (which itself is also very fragmented because of the multiple OEMs and technology systems involved).

Others are looking at specific pain points that result from the fragmentation, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/18\/secureframe-series-a-cybersecurity-compliance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Secureframe<\/a> with security compliance, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/01\/axonius-nabs-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-asset-management-cybersecurity-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axonius<\/a> with managing a plethora of endpoints, or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/17\/varmour-the-multi-cloud-security-startup-raises-58m-en-route-to-ipo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vArmour<\/a> with the challenges of working across multiple clouds.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making a platform play is significantly more ambitious, in particular in a market with so many strong point solutions, but with a lot of traction already for SenseOn, it&#8217;s a bet that investors want to take. \u201cSenseOn is poised to become a global cybersecurity leader,&#8221; said Alston Zecha of Eight Roads Ventures in a statement. &#8220;We have long looked for a company which coordinates detection intelligently across domains and can consolidate multiple tools into one solution.

Edison leads customer service platform Thankful\u2019s $12M round"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Customer service is one of the most important relationships between a business and its customer, and that was made even more clear during the global pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thankful.ai\/\">Thankful<\/a> AI CEO Ted Mico and his co-founder Evan Tann didn\u2019t start out with experience from the business side, they started the Venice, California-based company in 2018 out of frustration as customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCompanies will offer you a chat box, but no value along with it and a method that consumes vast amounts of time, and we thought we could change that,\u201d Mico told TechCrunch. \u201cThere were statistics that I read in media articles that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2017\/09\/25\/customer-service-is-a-350b-industry-and-its-a-mess\/?sh=7bff81b11bea\">customer service was a $350 billion business<\/a>, a large total addressable market, but it is a mess. We also read that we spend something like 43 days of our lives dealing with customer services. Well, Thankful is here to give you three weeks of your life back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, customer service is thought of as \u201cthe caboose\u201d of a business, but Thankful believes it should be the driver. As a result, companies spend large amounts of money in marketing to get a customer\u2019s attention, but when there is a problem or a customer has questions, it is a customer service team that comes in with little to no knowledge of any existing relationship, Mico added.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the paradigm that Thankful wants to shift. After being founded, the company spent more than two years building out its artificial intelligence customer service software. Mico called it \u201cthe application layer on top of the help desk,\u201d to handle large volumes of customer queries across any written channel that a customer wants to use, like email, social, in-app, chat or text. The platform has processed and learned from over 30 million customer service tickets so far.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UGZBqR8xUW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/customer-care-as-a-service-outsourcing-can-help-your-startup-wow-clients-24-7\/\">Customer care as a service: Outsourcing can help your startup wow clients 24\/7<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Customer care as a service: Outsourcing can help your startup wow clients 24\/7&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/22\/customer-care-as-a-service-outsourcing-can-help-your-startup-wow-clients-24-7\/embed\/#?secret=UGZBqR8xUW\" data-secret=\"UGZBqR8xUW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It has three products: the first is an agent assist that helps a human agent resolve problems by intelligently routing and suggesting replies, enabling the agent to be up to 40% more efficient. The second is an AI agent that manages the entire process, not only cutting the time to first response, but also resolving up to 50% of queries. The third is Thankful\u2019s analytics, which is just getting started, to provide data on what customers are saying about their journey.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past four years, Mico said the company has quietly curated a customer list that includes over 50 brands, including UntuckIt, FabFitFun and MeUndies. It is also partnering on the help desk side with companies like Zendesk, Kustomer and Gladly.<\/p>\n<p>Also during that time period, the company experienced 400% year over year growth. To continue to meet that demand, Thankful closed a new $12 million round of Series A funding. Joining Alpha Edison is Bonfire, Ten-One-Ten, Greycroft, Omega and Miramar. That, along with an unannounced $3 million, gives the company a total of $15 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208083\" style=\"width: 1224px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208083\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2208083 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1214\" height=\"906\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png 1214w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=150,112 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=300,224 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=768,573 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=680,507 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208083\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thankful Agent Assist. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Thankful<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company is the latest to go after customer service, an area that is also attracting venture capital and M&amp;A. For example, in the past few months, companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/31\/sanas-aims-to-convert-one-accent-to-another-in-real-time-for-smoother-customer-service-calls\/\">Sanas<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/26\/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service\/\">Zendesk<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/level-ai-lands-13m-series-a-to-build-conversational-intelligence-for-customer-service\/\">Level AI<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/goodcall-picks-up-4m-yelp-partnership-to-answer-merchant-inbound-calls\/\">Goodcall<\/a> have made news.<\/p>\n<p>Robey Miller, partner at Alpha Edison, said Thankful was an attractive investment because of the company&#8217;s focus on the post-purchase environment. Much of the data in this area is unstructured, so it is hard for brands to track it in a structured way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThankful provides a tool set instrumental in customer service in a way that has never been available in the past,\u201d he added. \u201cTraditionally, this area was measured by rudimentary metrics, and we think Thankful\u2019s technology makes sense of the data exhaust to allow you to understand how customer service drives or changes outcomes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miller believes that Thankful is well positioned to be at the forefront of experimenting and pushing the envelope with customer service as brands seek out tools that are insightful, actionable and something that they can trust.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mico intends to use the new funding to add more engineering talent as it expands its product line. The company is also planning to go into other verticals like finance, insurance and healthcare in coming years.<\/p>\n<p>Thankful charges customers based on volume of tickets and which product they are using. However, the company doesn\u2019t just sell the software, but enables customers to see it working before buying it. Thankful agents listen in on a potential customer\u2019s help desk for a couple of weeks to determine the brand\u2019s state of customer service and what could be learned with the data.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe next step for us is getting the data to the point of showing how your customer service operates \u2014 how to recognize patterns and help the brand improve,\u201d Mico said. \u201cThis is valuable information that is typically lost. Without the data, your business becomes an opinion-based business. We are trying to shine a light on that data.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RktDOD2SXq\"><p><a

The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving &#8211; too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of AKASA will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.","title":"Future Forward: How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation","videoUrl":"","sessionTypeId":0,"speakers":[{"name":"Varun Ganapathi","uuid":"564d8e601f91776b9ce6201af27cc6271632424483","cb_tag":576924146}],"sponsors":[{"address":{"city":"","country":"","state":"","street1":"","street2":"","zip":""},"categories":[],"content":"AKASA is building the future of healthcare with AI.
